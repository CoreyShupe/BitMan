# BitMan
My first Unity game written as a personal introduction to the tooling. <br />

This project is going to be a wing-it approach creating all assets and designs from scratch. Aseprite will be used to generate any pixel art in the game. <br />

More will come of this readme as I have the game more in-progress; for now a lot of the mechanics and design are still up in the air.
